\title{Maclane pentagon is some comonadic descent}

\begin{abstract}
\textsc{Rough Proof}.\emph{ }This Coq text responds to Gross \emph{Coq
Categories Experience} \cite{gross} and Chlipala \emph{Compositional
Computational Reflection} \cite{chlipala} of ITP 2014. ``Compositional''
is synonymous for functional/functorial and ``Computational Reflection''
is synonymous for monadic semantics; and this text attempts some comonadic
descent along functorial semantics : Dosen semiassociative coherence
covers Maclane associative coherence by some comonadic adjunction,
{$\text{embedding }:\ \text{SemiAssoc}\leftrightarrows\text{Assoc}\ :\text{ flattening reflection}$.

\maketitle

\section{Contents }

Categories \cite{borceux} study the interaction between reflections
and limits. The basic configuration for reflections is : 
\[
\xyC{5pc}\xyR{5pc}\xymatrix{\text{CoMod}\ar[r]^{\text{{reflection}}}\ar[d]_{\text{{identity}}}\ar@{}[ddr]\sp(0.2){\underset{\Longrightarrow}{\text{unit}}} & \text{Mod}\ar[dl]^{\text{{coreflection}}}\\
\text{CoMod}\ar[d]_{\text{{reification}}} & \ \\
\text{Modos} & \ 
}
\]
 where, for all $\text{reification}$ functor into any $\text{Modos}$
category, the map 
\[
(\ \_\star\text{reflection})\circ(\text{reification}\star\text{unit})
\]
 is bijective; or same, for all object $M'$ in $\text{CoMod}$, the
polymorphic in $M$ map { 
\[
(\text{coreflection}\ \_\ )\circ\text{unit}_{M'}:\text{Mod}(\text{reflection }M',M)\rightarrow\text{CoMod}(M',\text{coreflection }M)
\]
 }is bijective, and therefore also polymorphic in $M'$ with reverse
map $\text{counit}_{M}\circ(\text{reflection }\_\ )$ whose reversal
equations is polymorphically determined by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\text{coreflection}\star\text{counit})\circ(\text{unit}\star\text{coreflection}) & = & \text{identity}\\
(\text{counit}\star\text{reflection})\circ(\text{reflection}\star\text{unit}) & = & \text{identity\ }.
\end{eqnarray*}
 And it is said that the $\text{unit}$ natural/polymorphic/commuting
transformation is the \emph{unit of the reflection} and the reflective
pair $(\text{reification}\circ\text{coreflection},\text{reification}\star\text{unit})$
is some \emph{coreflective (``Kan'') extension functor} of the $\text{reification}$
functor along the $\text{reflection}$ functor. This text shows some
comonadic adjunction, { $\text{embedding }:\ \text{SemiAssoc}\leftrightarrows\text{Assoc}\ :\text{ flattening reflection}$.
}

Categories \cite{borceuxjanelidze} \cite{borceux} converge to the
\emph{descent technique}, this convergence is from both the \emph{functorial
semantics technique} with the \emph{monadic adjunctions technique}.
Now functorial semantics starts when one attempts to \emph{internalize}
the common phrasing of the logician model semantics, and this internalization
has as consequence some functionalization/functorialization saturation/normalization
of the original theory into some more synthetic theory; note that
here the congruence saturation is some instance of postfix function
composition and the substitution saturation is some instance of prefix
function composition. The ``Yoneda''/normalization lemma takes its
sense here. And among all the relations between synthetic theories,
get the \emph{tensor of theories}, which is some \emph{extension of
theories}, and which is the coproduct (disjoint union) of all the
operations of the component theories quotiented by extra \emph{commutativity}
between any two operations from any two distinct component theories;
for example the tensor of two rings with units as synthetic theories
gives the bimodules as functorial models.

Now Galois says that any radical extension of all the \emph{symmetric
functions} in some indeterminates, which also contains those indeterminates,
is abe to be incrementally/resolvably saturated/``algebra'' as some
further radical extension whose interesting endomorphisms include
all the permutations of the indeterminates. And when there are many
indeterminates, then some of those permutations are properly preserved
down the resolution ... but the resolution vanish any permutation
! In this context of saturated extensions, one then views any polynomial
instead as its quotient/ideal of some ring of polynomials and then
pastes such quotients into ``algebraic algebras'' or ``spectrums''
or ``schemes'' .. This is Galois descent along Borceux-Janelidze-Tholen
\cite{borceuxjanelidze}

\emph{Esquisse d'un programme} : The raw combinatorial (``permutation
group'') angle converge to Aigner \cite{aigner}. Another parallel
of the raw combinatorial techniques of Galois is the raw proof techniques
of Gentzen that inductive recursive arithmetic cannot well-order some
ordinal. One question is whether the descent techniques and the proof
techniques can converge. The initial item shall be to internalize/functorialize
the semantics of Dosen book and do \emph{automation programmation}
so to gather data and examples and experiments. The automation programming
technique has one common form mixing induction or simplification conversion
or logical unification or substitution rewriting or repeated heuristic/attempt
destructions or reflective decision procedure; for example the form
behind \emph{crush} of Chlipala CPDT \cite{chlipalacpdt} is :
\begin{quote}
{[} induction; \\
(eval beta iota; auto logical unify; auto substitution rewrite); \\
repeat ( (match goal | context match term => destruct); \\
(eval beta iota; auto logical unify; auto substitution rewrite) );
\\
congruence; omega; anyreflection {]}
\end{quote}
The next item shall be to memo Borceux books 1 and 2, not only from
the simplifying conversion angle or the unification (``logic programming'')
angle or the substitution rewrite angle, but also from the computational
reflection angle. This computational reflection angle shall be far
more than decision procedures, but rather shall be descent techniques
for existence (fullness) and identification (failfulness); so this
would allow for implicit arguments to be resolved after descent or
for some arguments to be programmed after descent to some easier terminology
.. This is 3 pages/day = 1 year memo reading.\input{itp2015.v.tex}
